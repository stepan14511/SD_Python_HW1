Student: Stepan Kuznetsov  
Idea is almost fully taken from the given example.

### How to run:  
```
$ python3 __init__.py
```

Custom questions can be made by inheriting of the QuestionBase class.

### Checklist:

- [x] 3 classes (3 was not enough in the example, so a bit more made);
- [x] Use at least 1 lambda (2 lambdas are used in the CustomPoll.startPoll function)
- [x] Use at least 1 decorator (in the file customPoll.py I used decorator to save results to JSON file).
